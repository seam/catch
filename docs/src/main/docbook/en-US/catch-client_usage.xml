      <title>Exception handlers</title>

      <para>
         As an application developer (i.e., an end user of Catch), you'll be focused on writing exception handlers. An
         exception handler is a method on a CDI bean that is invoked to handle a specific type of exception. Within that
         method, you can implement any logic necessary to handle or respond to the exception.
      </para>

      <!-- TODO: Do we really want to say they're scoped? They tyically aren't, and AFAIK, we're not taking scope into
      consideration. -->
      <para>
         Given that exception handler beans are CDI beans, they can make use of dependency injection, be scoped, have
         interceptors or decorators and any other functionality available to CDI beans.
      </para>

      <para>
         Exception handler methods are designed to follow the syntax and semantics of CDI observers, with some special
         purpose exceptions explained in this guide. The advantage of this design is that exception handlers will be
         immediately familiar to you if you are studying or well-versed in CDI.
      </para>

      <para>
         In this and subsequent chapters, you'll learn how to define an exception handler, explore how and when it gets invoked, modify
         an exception and a stack trace, and even extend Catch further through events that are fired during the handling
         workflow.  We'll begin by covering the two annotations that are used to declare an exception handler,
         <literal>@HandlesExceptions</literal> and <literal>@Handles</literal>.

      <title>Exception handler annotations</title>

      <para>
         Exception handlers are contained within exception handler beans, which are CDI beans annotated with
         <literal>@HandlesExceptions</literal>. Exception handlers are methods which have a parameter which is an 
         instance of <literal>CaughtException&lt;T extends Throwable&gt;</literal> annotated with the
         <literal>@Handles</literal> annotation.
      </para>

         <para>
            The
            <literal>@HandlesException</literal>
            annotation is simply a marker annotation that instructs the Seam
            Catch CDI extension to scan the bean for handler methods.

         <para>
            Let's designate a CDI bean as an exception handler by annotating it with
            <literal>@HandlesException</literal>.

            is a method parameter annotation that designates a method as an exception

            Let's look at an example. The following method is invoked for every exception that Catch processes and

   <section id="client_usage.exception_stack">
      <title>Exception stack chain processing</title>

      <para>
         When an exception is thrown, chances are it's nested (wrapped) inside other exceptions. (If you've ever
         examined a server log, you'll appreciate this fact). The collection of exceptions in its entirety is termed an
         exception stack chain.
      </para>

      <para>
         The outermost exception of an exception stack chain (e.g., EJBException, ServletException, etc) is probably of
         little use to exception handlers. That's why Catch doesn't simply pass the exception stack chain directly to
         the exception handlers. Instead, it intelligently unwraps the stack chain and treats the root exception cause
         as the primary exception.
      </para>

      <para>
         The first exception handlers to be invoked by Catch are those that match the type of root cause. Thus, instead
         of seeing a vague <literal>EJBException</literal>, your handlers will instead see an meaningful exception such
         as <literal>ConstraintViolationException</literal>.
         <emphasis>This feature, alone, makes Catch a worthwhile
            tool.
         </emphasis>
      </para>

      <!-- TODO: a graphic of layers (like rings) would be good here -->

      <para>
         Catch continues to work through the exception stack chain, notifying handlers of each exception in the stack,
         until a handler flags the exception as handled. Once an exception is marked as handled, Catch stops processing
         the exception. If a handler instructed Catch to rethrow the exception (by invoking
         <literal>CaughtException#rethrow()</literal>, Catch will rethrow the exception outside the Catch
         infrastructure. Otherwise, it simply returns flow control to the caller.
      </para>

      <para>
         Consider a stack chain containing the following nested causes (from outer cause to root cause):
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>EJBException</listitem>
         <listitem>PersistenceException</listitem>
         <listitem>SQLGrammarException</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Catch will unwrap this exception and notify handlers in the following order:
      </para>

      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>SQLGrammarException</listitem>
         <listitem>PersistenceException</listitem>
         <listitem>EJBException</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>
         If there's a handler for <literal>PersistenceException</literal>, it will likely prevent the handlers for
         <literal>EJBException</literal>
         from being invoked, which is a good thing since what useful information can
         really be obtained from <literal>EJBException</literal>?

   <section id="client_usage.handler_ordering">
      <title>Exception handler ordering</title>

      <para>
         While processing one of the causes in the exception stack chain, Catch has a specific order it uses to invoke
         the handlers, operating on two axes:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>traversal of exception type hierarchy</listitem>
         <listitem>relative handler precedence</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         We'll first address the traversal of the exception type hierarchy, then cover relative handler precedence.
      </para>

      <section id="client_usage.handler_ordering.hierarchy_traversal">
         <title>Traversal of exception type hierarchy</title>

         <para>
            Catch doesn't simply invoke handlers that match the exact type of the exception. Instead, it walks up and
            down the type hierarchy of the exception. It first notifies least specific handler in breadth first
            traversal mode, then gradually works down the type hiearchy towards handlers for the actual exception type,
            still in breadth first traversal. Once all breadth first traversal handlers have been invoked, the process
            is reversed for depth first traversal, meaning the most specific handlers are notified first and Catch
            continues walking up the hierarchy tree.
         </para>

         <para>
            There are two modes of this traversal:
         </para>

         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>BREADTH_FIRST</listitem>
            <listitem>DEPTH_FIRST</listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>
            By default, handlers are registered into the DEPTH_FIRST traversal path. That means in most cases, Catch
            starts with handlers of the actual exception type and works up towards the handler for the least specific
            type.
         </para>

         <para>
            However, when a handler is registered to be notified during the BREADTH_FIRST traversal, as in the example
            above, Catch will notify that exception handler before the exception handler for the actual type is
            notified.
         </para>

         <para>
            Let's consider an example. Assume that Catch is handling the <literal>SocketException</literal>. It will
            notify handlers in the following order:
         </para>

         <para>
            BREADTH_FIRST handlers are typically used for logging exceptions because they are not likely to be
            short-circuited (and thus always get invoked).

      <section id="precedence">
         <title>Handler precedence</title>

         <para>
            When Catch finds more than one handler for the same exception type, it orders the handlers by precedence.
            Handlers with higher precedence are executed before handlers with a lower precedence. If Catch detects two
            handlers for the same type with the same precedence, it detects it as an error and throws an exception at
            deployment time.
         </para>

         <para>
            Let's define two handlers with different precedence:
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[
void handleIOExceptionFirst(@Handles(precedence = 100) CaughtException<IOException> evt)

   System.out.println("Invoked first");
}

void handleIOExceptionSecond(@Handles CaughtException<IOException> evt)
{
   System.out.println("Invoked second");
}]]>
         </programlisting>

         <para>
            The first method is invoked first since it has a higher precedence (100) than the second method, which has
            the default precedence (0).
         </para>

         <para>
            To make specifying precedence values more convenient, Catch provides several built-in constants, available
            on the
            <literal>Precedence</literal>
            class:
         </para>

      <para>
         To summarize, here's how Catch determines the order of handlers to invoke (until a handler marks exception as
         handled):

         <title>CaughtException</title>

         <para>
            In addition to providing information about the exception being handled, the
            <literal>CaughtException</literal>
            object contains methods to control the exception handling process, such
            as rethrowing the exception, aborting the handler chain or unmuting the current handler.
         </para>

         <para>
            Five methods exist on the
            <literal>CaughtException</literal>
            object to give flow control to the handler
         </para>

         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <literal>abort()</literal>
               - terminate all handling immediately after this handler, does not mark the
               exception as handled, does not re-throw the exception.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <literal>rethrow()</literal>
               - continues through all handlers, but once all handlers have been called
               (assuming another handler does not call abort() or handled()) the initial exception passed to Catch is
               rethrown. Does not mark the exception as handled.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <literal>handled()</literal>
               - marks the exception as handled and terminates further handling.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <literal>markHandled()</literal>
               - default. Marks the exception as handled and proceeds with the rest of the
               handlers.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <literal>dropCause()</literal>
               - marks the exception as handled, but proceeds to the next cause in
               the cause container, without calling other handlers for the current cause.
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>
            Once a handler is invoked it is muted, meaning it will not be run again for that exception stack chain,
            unless it's explicitly marked as unmuted via the
            <literal>unmute()</literal>
            method on
            <literal>CaughtException</literal>.

         <title>ExceptionStack</title>

         <para>
            <literal>ExceptionStack</literal>
            contains information about the exception causes relative to the current
            exception cause. It is also the source of the exception types the invoked handlers are matched against. It
            is accessed in handlers by calling the method
            <literal>getExceptionStack()</literal>
            on the
            <literal>CaughtException</literal>
            object. Please see

               docs
            </ulink>
            for more information, all methods are fairly self-explanatory.

               Modifying the ExceptionStack may be useful to remove exception types that are effectively meaningless
               such as <literal>EJBException</literal>, changing the exception type to something more meaningful such
               as cases like <literal>SQLException</literal>, or wrapping exceptions as custom application exception
               types.

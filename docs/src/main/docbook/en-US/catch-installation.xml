   <title>Seam Catch - Installation</title>
   <para>
      To use the Seam Catch module, you need to add the Seam Catch API to your project as a compile-time dependency. At
      runtime, you'll also need the Seam Catch implementation, which you either specify explicitly or through a
      transitive dependency of another module that depends on it (as part of exposing its own Catch integration).
   </para>

   <para>
      First, check your application's library dependencies to see whether Seam Catch is already being included by
      another module (such as Seam Servlet). If not, you'll need to setup the dependencies as described below.

      <para>
	   	If you are using <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</ulink> as your build tool, you can add the
	   	following single dependency to your pom.xml file to include Seam Catch:
	   </para>
	   <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-catch</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.catch.version}</version>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
	   <tip>
	   	<para>
            Substitute the expression ${seam.catch.version} with the most recent or appropriate version of Seam Catch.
            Alternatively, you can create a <ulink
            href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/resource-filtering-sect-properties.html#resource-filtering-sect-user-defined">Maven
            user-defined property</ulink> to satisfy this substitution so you can centrally manage the version.
         </para>
	   </tip>
      <para>
         Alternatively, you can use the API at compile time and only include the implementation at runtime. This protects
         you from inadvertantly depending on an implementation class.
      </para>
	   <programlisting role="XML"><![CDATA[<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-catch-api</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.catch.version}</version>
   <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
   <groupId>org.jboss.seam.catch</groupId>
   <artifactId>seam-catch-impl</artifactId>
   <version>${seam.catch.version}</version>
   <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>]]></programlisting>
   </section>
   <para>
      Now you're ready to start catching exceptions!
